# VPC Spokes Configuration
# Configuration for all 8 VPC spokes per Carrier LLD Document
# - 4 Model spokes: M1P, M1NP, M3P, M3NP (in shared-services project)
# - 4 Network VPCs: Security Data, Security Mgmt, Shared Services, Transit
# "These all will set it up as spoke" - Vijay
# Deployed across 6 regions: us-east4, us-central1, europe-west3, europe-west1, asia-southeast1, asia-east2
