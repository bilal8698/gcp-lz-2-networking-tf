Carrier IaC Requirements (Ultra-Short Version)

⦁	Use Carrier Terraform Scaffold with enforced lint/security checks.

⦁	CI/CD via GitHub Enterprise with mandatory scans + TF Plan in PR.

⦁	Implement automated subnet vending using project metadata into Shared VPCs.

⦁	Apply mandatory tags (cost_center, owner, application, leanIX_app_id) on all resources.

⦁	Build NCC-based network automation aligned with CloudWAN architecture.

⦁	Enable network logging (Flow, DNS, LB) through IaC.

⦁	Follow standard repo/state structure with GCS backend.

⦁	Perform all testing safely in Model-1 / Model-3 folders.




PART 2 Solution Part Slide 2 Solution Section
✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅
1. Standardized Development & Governance

Adopt Carrier Terraform Scaffold for consistent development environment

Enforce all mandatory linting, validation, and security scans

Use GitHub Enterprise CI/CD with Terraform Plan in PR and main-branch deployments

2. Modular & Scalable IaC Architecture

Implement multi-repo Terraform structure (RM, Networking, NCC, Subnet Vending, Logging)

Use GCS backend for secure, controlled remote state storage

Limit state files for cleaner lifecycle management

3. Automated Subnet Vending

Build a metadata-driven subnet vending module

Automatically read project metadata & allocate subnets

Deploy subnets into Shared VPC folders with no manual steps

4. Compliance & Tag Enforcement

Embed mandatory tags (cost_center, owner, application, leanIX_app_id) into Terraform modules

Apply tags dynamically during subnet vending based on project metadata

5. Network Automation & Logging

Automate NCC Hub-and-Spoke deployment aligned with CloudWAN

Enable VPC Flow Logs, DNS Logs, and LB Logs through IaC

Integrate with Carrier’s central logging pipeline

6. Safe Testing & Validation

Execute all initial testing within Model-1 and Model-3 folders

Ensure zero impact to existing production workloads
